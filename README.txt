This project is to predict vehicle loan default.

The imbalanced dataset is trained on 4 models, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost. The models' performance indicates XGBoost as the optimal model, although there is still room for model improvement. The two most highly predictive features are state id and credit score, which is consistent with EDA findings. Assume that a good model performance is found, it is recommended to request 102334 customers whom the model predicts to have defaulted but actually not (yet) to mortgage their security against the loan as they are likely to default in the future.
