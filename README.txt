This project is to predict vehicle loan default. The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avikpaul4u/vehicle-loan-default-prediction?select=train.csv).

The imbalanced dataset was trained on 4 models, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XGBoost. The models' performance indicate Random Forest at threshold 0.2 as the optimal model due to the balanc. The two most highly predictive features are state id and credit score, which is consistent with EDA findings. It is recommended to request **102334** customers whom the model predicts to have defaulted but actually not to mortgage their security against the loan as they are very likely to default in the future.
